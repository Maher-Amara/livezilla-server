In case the user did not activate a licensing key, following the expiry of this 30-day period, the Software can only be used with a restricted range of functions. Subject to separate agreement, a licensing key authorises the use of LiveZilla in the basic version, or, subject to separate remuneration, the use of additional options.<br><br>

<br><br>
§ 4 Decompiling, program alterations<br><br>

2. Updates will in general be provided for free. Upgrades will be sold separately, the licensee has to pay the agreed remuneration.
<br><br>
§ 7 Internet access<br><br>
1. The software requires an Internet connection to the server of the licensor for product activation, for available update/upgrade checks, and for the execution of various different program functions such as calling up the program help function, FAQs and tutorials.<br><br>
2. All online costs incurred by the Licensee, i.e. the cost of connecting the Software with Licensor's or Licensee's server shall be borne by the Licensee. This includes all traffic costs and the costs of the Licensee's online time.
<br><br>
§ 8 Liability<br><br>
1. All liability of the Licensor, in particular in the scope of any claims of the Licensee for compensation and the reimbursement of any expenditure incurred without effect shall be based solely upon this clause, regardless of the legal nature of the claim.<br><br>
2. The Licensor is liable for intent and gross negligence as well as for breach of duty of care for life, limb or health, to an unlimited extent.<br><br>
3. In the case of slight negligence the Licensor is only liable for breach of a key contractual obligation (cardinal obligation). A cardinal obligation in the sense of this paragraph is an obligation whose fulfilment enables the implementation of the contract itself and upon whose fulfilment the contractual partners may consequently routinely depend.<br><br>
4. Deviating from paragraphs 2 and 3, in case of the free use of the software the licensor is not liable for gross negligence.<br><br>
5. In the case of paragraphs 3 and 4 the Licensor is not liable for insufficient economic success, loss of earnings and indirect loss.<br><br>
6. Liability as per the above paragraphs 3 and 5 is limited to five times the license fee, however, in this case and in case of paragraph 4 at maximum to the typical, foreseeable loss, to the extent that this exceeds the aforementioned amount.<br><br>
7. The liability limitations also apply respectively in favour of the employees, agents, legal representatives and assistants of the Licensor. In the case of liability of simple assistants the limitation of liability of paragraph 6 shall also apply for intent and gross negligence.<br><br>
8. The liability for a loss of data is limited to the typical recovery expense that would have been incurred in case of a regular and risk-adequate creation of backup copies by the Licensee.<br><br>
9. Any liability of the Licensor for guarantees issued and claims on the basis of product liability law remains unaffected.
<br><br>
§ 9 Warranty claims<br><br>
1. Licensor points out that according to the current state of technology it is not possible to develop software which is completely free of errors. Thus, Licensee has no claims and no warranty applies for software errors that do not or only insignificantly adversely affect the usability of the Software.
2. The Licensor shall rectify defects in the supplied Software (material defects and defects in title) within the warranty period of two years if the Licensee is a consumer, in all other cases within a warranty period of 12 months starting with the first program download following appropriate notification by the Licensee. The Licensor shall be entitled to rectify the defect in the Software free of charge, or supply fault-free replacement software. In the case of replacement delivery, the Licensor shall also be entitled to supply a new program version with at least equivalent functionality unless it is unacceptable for the Licensee, for example in the case of the necessity of another operating system or hardware with higher performance. The replacement delivery and initial delivery are made by way of providing the Software via the Website and subsequent download by the Licensee.<br><br>
3. If the defect cannot be rectified within a reasonable period, of if the subsequent improvement or replacement delivery is to be considered to have failed for other reasons, the Licensee may, at his or her discretion, reduce the purchase price, withdraw from the contract, claim compensatory damages or compensation for lost expenses. The last two claims are provided for in accordance with 9 of this Licensing Contract. Withdrawing from the contract does not exclude the right to compensatory damages.<br><br>
4. A failure of the subsequent improvement or replacement delivery may only be assumed if the Licensor has been given ample opportunity to provide subsequent improvement or replacement delivery without achieving the desired success, if the subsequent improvement of replacement delivery is impossible, if they are rejected by the Licensor or are delayed to such an extent as to be unacceptable, if there are justified doubts regarding the prospects of success or if action is unacceptable for other reasons.<br><br>
5. Deviating from the paragraphs 2 through 4, Licensor is only liable for material defects and defects of title under the requirements of Sections 523 and 524 of the German Civil Code.
<br><br>
§ 10 Obligation to inspect and provide notification of defects<br><br>
The following only applies for entrepreneurs ("Unternehmer" as defined in Sec. 14 of the German Civil Code): The Licensee undertakes to inspect the supplied Software for obvious defects, which an average customer would easily notice. The Software shall be deemed accepted if Licensor is not informed of a defect in the case of an obvious defect without delay after downloading the Software, otherwise within five workdays after the defect is identified.
<br><br>
§ 11 Reservation of title<br><br>
The Licensor reserves ownership of the Software supplied to the Licensee up until payment in full of all claims resulting from this contractual relationship that exist at the time of delivery or arise later.
<br><br>
§ 12 Final provisions<br><br>
1. All legal relations resulting from this contractual relationship shall be governed by the law of the Federal Republic of Germany under the exclusion of conflict of law provisions, especially the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.<br><br>
2. If the Licensee is a merchant within the meaning of Section 1 (1) of the German Commercial Code, a legal entity under public law or special federal funds, the courts in D-78224 Singen shall have exclusive jurisdiction for all disputes resulting from or in conjunction with the affected contractual relationship. Licensor is entitled to bring an action against the Licensee in any other legally permissible place of jurisdiction. If the Licensee is a consumer ("Verbraucher" as defined in Sec. 13 of the German Civil Code), the provisions of the German Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung) apply in respect of determining the place of jurisdiction.<br><br>
3. Terms and conditions of business of the Licensee or third parties shall not apply, even if the Licensor does not separately object to their validity in individual cases.<br><br>
4. Insofar as this Software Licensing Contract proves to contain provisions that are or become invalid, all other provisions shall remain in full force and effect. The invalid provision shall be replaced by a legally valid regulation that comes nearest to the wishes of the contractual partners. The same applies in case of a loophole.
